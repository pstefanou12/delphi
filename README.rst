Introduction
============

This repository contains three jupyter notebooks to run the experiments mentioned
in the paper. The jupyter notebook with the name 'Istanbul Stock Exchange Data Experiment.ipynb',
contains the code for the semi-synthetic data experiment. For this experiment, we use code from the UCI 

The jupyter notebook with the name
Union of Interval Truncated Regression contains the code for the union of interval regression experiment.
Lastly, the notebook with the name Varying C contains the code for the experiment with varying truncation
parameter C.

Note
----

The notebooks are located within the notebooks directory of the repository. They have instructions on how to execute the experiments. The experiments should
run by executing the cells in order. Further, if there are dependency issues, try creating a virutal environment 
and install dependencies with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
